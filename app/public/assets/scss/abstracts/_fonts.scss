// /*  Ways to include fonts:
// 	URL references to outside server:
// 		+ for an example, if it's a google font, there is a high chance their servers have less latency and better caching mechanism
// 		+ easier font management, just 1 line in header or @import

// 	URL references to local server:
// 		- complicated font management
// 		- if you have to generate webfont yourself, then fonts generated by webfont generators (like fontsquirrel) need to be manually adjusted in their settings, because they tend to come out distorted

//WOFF / WOFF2 ---> Stands for: Web Open Font Format.
// Created for use on the web, and developed by Mozilla in conjunction with
// other organizations, WOFF fonts often load faster than other formats because
// they use a compressed version of the structure used by OpenType (OTF) and TrueType
// (TTF) fonts. This format can also include metadata and license info within the font file.
// This format seems to be the winner and where all browsers are headed.

//OTF  / TTF   ---> Stands for: OpenType Font and TrueType Font.
//The WOFF format was initially created as a reaction to OTF and TTF, in part,
//because these formats could easily (and illegally) be copied, However, OpenType
//has capabilities that many designers might be interested in (ligatures and such).

//EOT          ---> Stands for: Embedded Open Type.
// This format was created by Microsoft (the original innovators of @font-face) and
// is a proprietary file standard supported only by IE.
// In fact, itâ€™s the only format that IE8 and below will recognize when using @font-face.

// REGULAR FONT - 400
